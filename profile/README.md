## What is Loopback for Mac?  

Loopback Mac is a **virtual audio routing software** that gives you full control over sound on your macOS system.

With Loopback audio Mac, you can:  
- Route music from Spotify into Zoom calls.  
- Combine a microphone and background music into a single audio feed.  
- Capture system audio directly into recording apps.  
- Create custom audio workflows without extra hardware.  

Loopbackâ€™s interface is intuitive, with a drag-and-drop design that makes building virtual devices simple. Each source and output is visually represented, so even complex audio setups can be managed without confusion.  

### Why use Loopback on Mac?
